## Rocketsearch (Work In Progress!)

A search engine for torrent links, magnet links, and other downloads

### Goals

- Aggregate data from different providers every X minutes
- Save it in an object that Rocketsearch can understand
- Create a whole database, with a search engine
- Use AI and algorithms to mark fake/weird/dead/different torrents
- Sanitize metadata such as titles to make it more understandable
- Make it accessible offline

> **Example**: Ariana Grande - Dangerous Woman (Deluxe) [MP3~320Kbps]
> - Title: Dangerous Woman by Ariana Grande (Deluxe Edition)
> - Category: Album
> - Format: MP3 (320 Kbps)


This is a **WIP** project. As I can't allow much of my time to coding, the development is gonna be slow.
